#Tracking machine using one HC-SR04
You need Servo.h and NewPing.h for arduino Also need HC-SR04 and servo motor

This uses only one HC-SR04 to tracking object

This is not final code. This code should be modified (if you move object too fast, it doesn't work perfectly :( )

#I am not expert.
The examples that tracking object using HC-SR04 on the internet deal with only two or more HC-SR04s. So I thought that It should be also able to work that process using just one HC-SR04.

If you have a great idea of correcting this code, please do that!
